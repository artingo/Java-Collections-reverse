# Reverse the order of the list

## Overview:
A common operation on lists is filtering and sorting. There exists a utility "Collections" class, but you should 
know how to sort lists yourself.

## Task
Write a generic function (without using the "Collections" class) that reverses the order of the elements in a list. 
Modify the list itself, don't return a new list!

### Input / Output:
"Alfie", "Betty", "Caty", "Dora", "Emilie", "Frida" --> "Frida", "Emilie", "Dora", "Caty", "Betty", "Alfie"  
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610 --> 610, 377, 233, 144, 89, 55, 34, 21, 13, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1  
-0.9998, -0.7071, 0, 0.3746, 0.7660 --> 0.766, 0.3746, 0.0, -0.7071, -0.9998
